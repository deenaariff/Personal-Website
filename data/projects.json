		              – such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke,
		               and cancer – in resource-poor countries 
		               today are preventable and/or treatable, 
		               and have been for decades. Additionally, 
		               as the world develops and changes, the 
		               medical paradigm has shifted; rather 
		               than responding primarily to humanitarian 
		               emergencies and infectious diseases, 
		               health care providers must now also focus 
		               on managing chronic illnesses and creating 
		               sustainable health systems. The Heal Initiative
		               exists to consistently deliver care to those 
		               in need.",
